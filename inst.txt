You are operating as a **senior-plus frontend engineer under hiring-bar conditions**.
This is a **pass/fail assignment**. Partial completion is **failure**.
You must **deliver working software**.

## ABSOLUTE OBJECTIVE

Reproduce **Axiom Trade’s Token Discovery Table** with **pixel-level accuracy**.

Reference (open and inspect visually):
https://axiom.trade/pulse](https://axiom.trade/pulse

If a human can visually distinguish your UI from the reference without zooming, **you failed**.

---

## HARD FAILURE CONDITIONS (READ CAREFULLY)

You **fail immediately** if ANY of the following occur:

* Missing **any** column or interaction present on the reference site
* Using placeholders instead of real mock logic
* Skipping WebSocket simulation
* Returning pseudocode or “example” components
* Producing an app that cannot be deployed
* Lighthouse score < 90 on **both** mobile and desktop
* Layout shifts during live price updates
* Components not reusable outside this table
* README missing screenshots or instructions
* Any deliverable missing

There is **no partial credit**.

---

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Token Table

* Implement **all three sections**:

  * New Pairs
  * Final Stretch
  * Migrated
* Each section must behave exactly like the reference:

  * Sorting
  * Sticky headers
  * Hover behavior
  * Click behavior
* Data must feel **real**, not toy data.

### Interaction Matrix (ALL REQUIRED)

You must explicitly implement **every** interaction type below:

| Interaction | Where                |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| Tooltip     | Metadata, timestamps |
| Popover     | Quick token actions  |
| Modal       | Full token details   |
| Hover       | Row + cell           |
| Click       | Navigation or modal  |
| Sorting     | Multi-column         |
| Focus       | Keyboard accessible  |

If any interaction is missing, you fail.

---

## REAL-TIME SYSTEM (NO CHEATING)

* Implement a **mock WebSocket server**
* Emit price updates at variable intervals
* Animate price changes:

  * Green on up
  * Red on down
  * Smooth transitions
* **NO layout shift**
* Updates must not trigger full table re-renders

If performance degrades under updates, you fail.

---

## LOADING & FAILURE STATES (ALL REQUIRED)

You must implement **all** of the following visibly:

* Skeleton loaders
* Shimmer effects
* Progressive loading
* Error boundaries
* Retry UI
* Empty states

Each must be triggerable and testable.

---

## TECH STACK (STRICT — DO NOT SUBSTITUTE)

* Next.js 14 **App Router only**
* TypeScript with `"strict": true`
* Tailwind CSS
* Redux Toolkit (non-trivial usage)
* React Query (data fetching + caching)
* Radix UI / Headless UI / shadcn/ui only

No shortcuts. No alternatives.

---

## ARCHITECTURE ENFORCEMENT

You must follow **Atomic Design** strictly:

* atoms
* molecules
* organisms
* templates
* pages

Additional requirements:

* Custom hooks for data + sockets
* Shared utilities
* Memoized selectors
* Zero duplicate logic
* Components must be reusable in isolation

Any monolithic component = fail.

---

## PERFORMANCE BUDGET (ENFORCED)

* Interaction latency < **100ms**
* CLS ≈ 0
* No unnecessary re-renders
* Virtualization if dataset size requires it
* Lighthouse score ≥ 90 (mobile + desktop)

If you don’t measure it, it doesn’t count.

---

## UI ACCURACY (NO EXCUSES)

* Fonts, spacing, colors must match reference
* Hover states must match
* Row height must match
* Padding must match
* Responsive down to **320px**

Deviation > 2px = fail.

---

## DELIVERABLES (ALL REQUIRED — NO EXCEPTIONS)

### 1. GitHub Repository

* Clean, logical commits
* Meaningful commit messages
* No dead code
* README with:

  * Setup instructions
  * Architecture explanation
  * Performance decisions
  * Screenshots (desktop + mobile)

### 2. Vercel Deployment

* Production build
* No runtime errors
* Optimized assets

### 3. Public YouTube Video (1–2 min)

* Show:

  * Real-time updates
  * Sorting
  * Modals/popovers
  * Loading states
  * Responsive behavior

If any link is missing, the assignment is rejected.

---

## EXECUTION ORDER (MANDATORY)

You must execute in this order:

1. Scaffold Next.js 14 project
2. Configure strict TypeScript + Tailwind
3. Implement architecture skeleton
4. Build reusable UI primitives
5. Implement mock backend + WebSocket
6. Build table with full interactions
7. Add loading & error states
8. Optimize performance
9. Deploy to Vercel
10. Produce README + demo script

Skipping steps is not allowed.

---

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

You must output:

* Exact folder structure
* Full source code for critical files
* Commands to run locally
* Deployment instructions

Do NOT:

* Explain concepts
* Suggest alternatives
* Ask clarifying questions

Assume **senior engineers will review your code line-by-line**.

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTION

This is not an exercise.
This is a **hiring-bar simulation**.

**Start building now.**
